# Chapter 1: Simple Statistics
Statistics is the foundation of modern machine learning. People who are knowledgeable of statistics can not only model complex relationships between two or more variables but also perform calculations that minimize error in conclusions drawn from their models.

Although we will learn more difficult statistical concepts later in the text, we must first start off with simpler ones. As a matter of fact, these might be the easiest concepts to grasp in this entire book. But don't let that scare you! Think of high school level statistics; the main ideas are mean, median, and mode. I'm sure you already know them, but we'll review them just in case. To refresh your memory, the mean of a set of values is the average of those values, or the sum of the values divided by how many values there are. The median is the middle of the values. And, the mode is the value that is repeated most often. Although rudimentary, these ideas are essential in understanding high level machine learning concepts.

Calculating the mean, median, and mode is very simple. Before we perform any calculation, we need to know what data we need and how it should be formatted. With mean, median, and mode, we prefer having the elements of our dataset (the numbers) be in ascending order (from least to greatest). So, if we're given a set of numbers {3, 1, 5, 0}, we want to rearrange these numbers so that they appear {0, 1, 3, 5}.

So, let's get into it. Here are the empirical equations for these three values. Given a set of numbers, X, where X = {0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4},

Mean (denoted by the greek letter "mu"):

\(\huge{\mu = \frac{ \sum_{i=0}^{len(X)}X_i } { len(X) } } \)

Median:

\(\huge{ \widetilde{x} = X_{ \frac{len(X)+1}{2} } }\)

Mode:

\(\huge{Mo_Y = most(Y)}\)

But, what do those equations mean? Let's break them down, so we can better understand them.

Mean has two simple components. The numerator is the series of X, and the denominator is the length of X. So, the mean of X is the sum of all of its values, 12, divided by the length of X, 6. So, the mean of X, \(\large{\mu_X}\), is 2!

Median is the middle of X. It's the element of X that has the index of \(\large{ \frac{len(X)+1}{2} }\). The catch with that is: if the length is even, then the median is the mean of the two middle numbers (we'll go more in depth on that later). So, X is of even length, and the two middle numbers are 2 and 2. Therefore, the median is \(\large{\frac{2+2}{2}}\), or 2!

Mode is even simpler than its counterparts. It's literally the whatever value appears the most in X. Here, we see that 0, 1, 3, and 4 appear once in X, but 2 appears twice in X. 2 appears most in X, so 2 is the mode, \(Mo_X\)!

In that example, it was just a coincidence that all three of the values are 2, but we'll see examples that aren't as easy.

## Bring It All Together

Now that we know what mean, median, and mode are, we know our simple statistics concepts! Let's solve a real world problem using what we just learned.

Say you have six friends who work at the same McDonald's restaurant. Their salaries are $140, $220, $90, $180, $140, and $200. This is our dataset, now let's find the mean, median, and mode for their salaries. To make things a bit simpler, we'll call the set of values Y.

Let's find the mean, \(\large{\mu_Y}\), first.
We recall that the mean is \(\large{\mu_Y = \frac{ \sum_{i=0}^{len(Y)}Y_i } { len(Y) } } \).

The numerator is the sum of all of the salaries, which is 140+220+90+180+140+200, or 970. So now we have:

\(\large{\mu_Y = \frac{ 970 } { len(Y) } } \)

The denominator is the length of Y, which is 6 because we have six friends and six salaries:

\(\large{\mu_Y = \frac{ 970 } { 6 } } \)

And with a calculator and some rounding:

\(\large{\mu_Y = 161.\bar{6}} \)

\(\large{\mu_Y = $161.67} \)

The mean of the salaries is $161.67. Also, keep in mind that **the mean doesn't have to be a value in the dataset**.



For the median, \(\large{ \widetilde{x}_Y}\), we need to put our data in ascending order. So, Y becomes { 90, 140, 140, 180, 200, 220 }. If we look at Y as a list of numbers we see,

90 140 140 180 200 220

There's an even number of values in Y, therefore the midpoint isn't one number.

90 140 140 **I** 180 200 220

So, we find the mean of the two middle numbers.

90 140 **140 180** 200 220

In this case, we find the sum of 140 and 180 then divide by 2 since they're only two numbers.

\(\large{ \widetilde{x}_Y =\frac{ 140 + 180 } { 2 } }\)

\(\large{ \widetilde{x}_Y =$160 }\)

The median value is $160. As you can see, **the median also doesn't have to be a value in the dataset**.



Finally the mode, \(Mo_Y\) this will almost always be the easiest value to find. Let's look at our values.

90 140 140 180 200 220

If we look at how many times each value appears, we can see that 90, 180, 200, and 220 each appear once in Y, but 140 appears twice.

90 **140 140** 180 200 220

So, $140 is our mode.

\(Mo_Y = 140\)

**The mode doesn't have to be a value in the dataset**. But, it is in this case.



Congratulations! You've finished this chapter!
